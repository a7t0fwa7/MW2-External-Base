# MW2-External-Base
this is something ive coded over a little while and it was never sold or for a p2c, this is for educational purposes, please dont sell this, its not even complete.
you will also need to decrypt the process enviroment block as the driver i included in here doesnt handle that,  i just added the internal way (__readgsqword)
this hijacks for overlay (hijacking medel), it supports vsync and it uses dx11, and also hooks NtUserInjectMouseInput instead of regular mouse event.
ive done most of the code which is needed and made a pretty okay loop, you can go caching way if you want i provided the base code for that and this is pretty solid code i would say.
i hope yall enjoy
